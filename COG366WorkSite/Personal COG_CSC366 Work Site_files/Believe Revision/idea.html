      <p>Following is our ideas of problems involving believe revisions.</p>

      <div class="block">
        <p><pre>
<b>Idea 1:</b> <i>Train rides</i>
        We can model a system consist of train stations, routes, and a rider. The stations have routes that run through them, and the routes will bring the rider to different stations.
    The rider will try to get from one station to the other, believeing that he can go through such and such stations and routes to arrive at the destination.
    But during his journey the system can change, like closed stations and routes, in order to convince the rider to go on different routes.

<b>Idea 2:</b> <i>Plane travels</i>
        This idea is very simular to idea 1, instead of trains the traveling method is going to be planes. We will model a system consis of airports, flight routes, and a passenger.
    The passenger is a very busy man so therefore he travels a lot, while doing so he is also trying to find the best flight to take.
    But in an rapidly changing world no flights will remain the best.

<b>Idea 3:</b> <i>Going to class</i>
        We can model a system that includes buildings, classrooms, hallways, and a student. The student will have a list of classes to attend and he will try to find the best
    route to his next class, however the informations he learned along the way may or may not alter the path he is trying to take.

      <p>Currently we have agreed on idea 1.</p>
